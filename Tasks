Add a local host in /etc/ansible/hosts

# ansible localhost -m ping 

* if you run this command it throws error because we havent created user.
* That the reason we have created a user called ansible.

# sudo useradd ansible
# sudo /etc/ssh/sshd_cnfig > password authentication > yes
# sudo systemctl restart sshd
# ansible localhost -m ping -u ansible --ask-pass

Note: if after given password also failing to login. Use below command

# export ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP=/tmp/ansible-temp

* if you want to login to specific user use below command. We should pass the user name in hosts file like ansible_user=ansible

# ansible localhost -m ping --ask-pass

* if you want to login to without password to  user use below command. We should add the password of the user name in hosts file like ansible_ssh_pass=lovedreams@143

# ansible localhost -m ping

* if you want to login to the user using ssh. First copy the pem key and paste in the server.

# ansible localhost -m ping --key-file <path of the key file present>

* If you want to access the remote server from ansible. Create a new instance and copy the public ip address in the /etc/ansible/hosts path.

# 3.110.183.102 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/key

* To check the access from ansible server to remote server use below command
# ansible remote -a "cat /etc/hostname"
# ansible local -a "cat /etc/hostname"
# ansible all -a "cat /etc/hostname"
# ansible -i /home/ubuntu/ansible/hosts all -m ping  (Command fro our own inventory file)
