* If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control.
* Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management.
* We can write multiple plays in the same playbook to execute them on remote hosts.
* Playbooks sometimes referred as a blueprint of tasks which can be used to automate the complex and time consuming IT actions with limited or no human involvement.
* Playbooks are written in YAML syntax
